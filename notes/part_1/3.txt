Given a sorted integer array and an integer key,
find the first and last occurance of key in array
for ex: 1 1 2 2 2 3 4 4



Given a sorted rotated integer array of distinct elements and an integer key,
find index of key
for ex: 6 7 1 2 3 4 5



Given a sorted integer array of n elements
n >= 2
all elements from [1, n - 1] are present only once except 1 element which occurs twice
find that element which is repeating or occurs twice
for ex: 1 2 3 3 4



Given an integer array
find peak in array
a element is peak
iff element >= left_adj_element
    ans element >= right_adj_element

for ex: 10 20 15 2 23 90 67





extra problem:
Given an unsorted array
all elements come in a pair together except one.
find that single element

for ex: 4 4 1 1 3 7 7 6 6
