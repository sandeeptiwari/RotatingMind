 /*
	* Write an efficient function that checks whether any permutation of an input string is a palindrome
	* Examples:
	*
	*	"civic" should return true
	*	"ivicc" should return true
	*	"civil" should return false
	*	"livci" should return false
	*
	* "But 'ivicc' isn't a palindrome!"
	*	If you had this thought, read the question again carefully. We're asking if any permutation of the string is a palindrome. 
	*	Spend some extra time ensuring you fully understand the question before starting. Jumping in with a flawed understanding of 
	*	the problem doesn't look good in an interview.
	*
	*What would be the time cost? For a string of length n, there are n! permutations (n choices for the first character, times nâˆ’1 choices for the second character, etc). 
	*Checking each length-n permutation to see if it's *a palindrome involves checking each character, taking O(n)O(n) time. That gives us O(n!n)O(n!n) time overall. We can do better!
