Stub and Skeleton:-
	- stub is located at C, looking for unique name in registry.
	- stub is responsible to search server's methods.
	- 
	
	- The server side object participating in distributed object 
	  communication is known as a skelton.
	- A skelton acts as gateway for server side objects and all 
	  incoming clientsrequests are routed through it. The skelton
	  wraps server object functionality and eposes it to the clients
	  ,moreover by adding the network logic ensures the reliable
	   communication channel between clients and server.
	   Skeleton can e written up manually or generated automatically
	   depending on chosen communication protocol.
	- Traslating incoming data from the stub to the correct up-calls server
	   objects.
	-unmarshalling of the arguments from received data.
	-passing arguments to server object.
	-marshalling of the return values from server objects.
