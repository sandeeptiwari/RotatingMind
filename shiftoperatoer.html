How do the bitwise shift operators work?
The bitwise shift operators take two operands: the first is a quantity to be shifted, and the second specifies the number of bit positions by which the first operand is to be shifted. The direction of the shift operation is controlled by the operator used. Shift operators convert their operands to 32 or 64 bits and return a result of the same type as the left operator.

Shift Operators
Operator	Use	Description
<<	op1 << op2	Shifts bits of op1 left by distance op2; fills with 0 bits on the right side
>>	op1 >> op2	Shifts bits of op1 right by distance op2; fills with highest (sign) bit on the left side
>>>	op1 >>> op2	Shifts bits of op1 right by distance op2; fills with 0 bits on the left side
Shifting is basically taking the binary equivalent of a number and moving the bit pattern left or right.

Left Shift Operator <<
This operator shifts the first operand the specified number of bits to the left. Excess bits shifted off to the left are discarded. 
Zero bits are shifted in from the right. For example,

Consider 12 whose binary equivalent is 00000000 00000000 00000000 00001100 (binary for 32 bits). Remember that the type operands 
(such as byte and short) are implicitly promoted to the int type before any shift operators are applied. Let's shift it left 2 times.

00000000 00000000 00000000 00001100 << 2(times)
When you shift left ( << ) the void left behind by the shift is filled by zero's. This is the result of (12<<2):

00000000 00000000 00000000 00110000 (48)
Consider -12 whose binary equivalent is 11111111 11111111 11111111 11110100 (binary for 32 bits). Let's shift it left 2 times.

11111111 11111111 11111111 11110100 << 2(times)
When you shift left ( << ) the void left behind by the shift is filled by zero's. This is the result of (-12<<2):

11111111 11111111 11111111 11010000 (-48)
Let's do -12<<28 and the result is

01000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 (1073741824)
 

Right Shift Operator >>
This operator shifts the first operand the specified number of bits to the right. Excess bits shifted off to the right are discarded. 
Copies of the leftmost bit are shifted in from the left.

Consider 12 whose binary equivalent is 00000000 00000000 00000000 00001100 (binary for 32 bits). Remember that the type operands 
(such as byte and short) are implicitly promoted to the int type before any shift operators are applied. Let's shift it right 2 times.

00000000 00000000 00000000 00001100 >> 2(times)
When shifting right ( >> ) the leftmost bits exposed by the right shift are filled in with previous contents of the leftmost bit. 
This is the result of (12>>2):

00000000 00000000 00000000 00000011 (3)
Consider -12 whose binary equivalent is 11111111 11111111 11111111 11110100 (binary for 32 bits). Let's shift it right 2 times.

11111111 11111111 11111111 11110100 >> 2(times)
When shifting right ( >> ) the leftmost bits exposed by the right shift are filled in with previous contents of the leftmost bit. 
This is the result of (-12>>2):

11111111 11111111 11111111 11111101 (-3)
Note that right shifting ( >> ) always preserves the sign of the original number i.e. to say that a negative number will stay negative 
while a positive number will stay positive after a right shift ( >> ).

 

Unsigned Right Shift Operator >>>
This operator shifts the first operand the specified number of bits to the right. Excess bits shifted off to the right are discarded. 
Zero bits are shifted in from the left.

When shifting right ( >> ) the leftmost bits exposed by the right shift are filled in with previous contents of the leftmost bit. BUT, 
the >>> unsigned right shift operator always fill zero's and only zero's no matter positive and negative number. For example,

Let's do 00000000 00000000 00000000 00001100 >>> 2 (12>>>2) and the result is 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000011 (3).
Let's do 11111111 11111111 11111111 11110100 >>> 2 (-12>>>2) and the result is 00111111 11111111 11111111 11111101 (1073741821).
What is the Range for Shift Distance op2?
If the promoted type of the left-hand operand is int, only the five lowest-order bits of the right-hand operand are used as the shift
distance. It is as if the right-hand operand were subjected to a bitwise logical AND operator &  with the mask value 0x1f. The shift distance actually used is therefore always in the range 0 to 31, inclusive.

For example, the shift distance op2 is 34 in the op1 >> 34 (op1 is int type) . The 34's binary equivalent is 00100010 and it over the 
rang [0,31]. The actually shift distance is op2 & 0x1f = 0x02. Thus, (op1 >> 34) has the same result as (op1 >> 2) .

Let's take a look another example 12<<-3. The -3 binary representation is 11111101. Then op2= 0xfd & 0x1f = 0x1d = 29. 
The result of (12<<-3) has the same result as (12<<29).< /p>

 

If the promoted type of the left-hand operand is long, then only the six lowest-order bits of the right-hand operand are used as the 
shift distance. It is as if the right-hand operand were subjected to a bitwise logical AND operator &  with the mask value 0x3f. The shift distance actually used is therefore always in the range 0 to 63, inclusive.

For example, the shift distance op2 is 69 in the op1 >> 69 (op1 is long type) . The 69's binary equivalent is 01000101 and it over the 
rang [0,63]. The actually shift distance is op2 & 0x3f = 0x05. Thus, (op1 >> 69) has the same result as (op1 >> 5) .
