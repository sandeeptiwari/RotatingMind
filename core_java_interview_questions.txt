Q- BlockingQueue:-
It is not possible to insert null into a BlockingQueue. If you try to insert null, 
the BlockingQueue will throw a NullPointerException.

It is also possible to access all the elements inside a BlockingQueue, and not just 
the elements at the start and end. For instance, say you have queued an object for 
processing, but your application decides to cancel it. You can then call e.g. 
remove(o) to remove a specific object in the queue. However, this is not done 
very efficiently, so you should not use these Collection methods unless you really 
have to.

Implementation classes:-
	ArrayBlockingQueue
	DelayQueue
	LinkedBlockingQueue
	PriorityBlockingQueue
	SynchronousQueue
