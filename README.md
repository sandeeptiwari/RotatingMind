Given two strings, find if first string is a subsequence of second
Given two strings str1 and str2, find if str1 is a subsequence of str2. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements (source: wiki). Expected time complexity is linear.

Examples:

Input: str1 = "AXY", str2 = "ADXCPY"
Output: True (str1 is a subsequence of str2)

Input: str1 = "AXY", str2 = "YADXCP"
Output: False (str1 is not a subsequence of str2)

Input: str1 = "gksrek", str2 = "geeksforgeeks"
Output: True (str1 is a subsequence of str2)

Solution :- Opene FindOrderOfString.java class and just run it and you can also manipulate is as per your test.

 Bubble Sort example {3, 44, 38, 5, 47, 15, 36, 26, 27, 2, 46, 4, 19, 50, 38}
 
 Solution:- Open BubbleSort.java class and simply run it and for better concept see below video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyZQPjUT5B4 .
  
  # 3.
  
   Longest Palindromic Substring (Java).
   Example:-
           input String s = "HYTBCABADEFGHABCDEDCBAGHTFYW1234567887654321ZWETYGDE". 
           output String  =  "1234567887654321".
   Solution:- Open LongestPalindrom.java class and run it Or see below link
